## Running
1. Ensure you have [Go 1.23 or newer](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed

   - `ELF_DISCORD_TOKEN`: Discord token for the bot user to run as
   - `ELF_DISCORD_APP_ID`: ID of the Discord app the bot belongs to
   - `ELF_DISCORD_GUILD_ID`: ID of the Discord guild to register commands on. Leave blank if you're looking to run a production instance of the bot. If you're working on the bot, provide the ID of the guild you will be testing in
   - `ELF_ADVENT_OF_CODE_SESSION`: Advent of Code session cookie for the bot user
4. Run `go run . run`

## Unregistering Commands

If you were using a testing bot, and need to clean up the command registrations, you can use a tool such as [command-clearer](https://github.com/nint8835/command-clearer) to remove existing commands.

## Manually Registering Guilds

If you are developing (or if the onboarding process still doesn't exist as of you reading this), it is helpful to manually insert a testing guild into the database. This can be done with the `testdata` tool included.

Example:

```sh
go run . testdata
```
